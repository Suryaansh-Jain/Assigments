\begin{frame}{Assignment 9}
	\frametitle{Problem}
	Brand A batteries cost more than brand B batteries. Their life lengths are two normal and
independent random variables $x$ and $y$. We test 16 batteries of brand A and 26 batteries of brand B and find these values in hours:
$\bar x =4.6\ s_x = 1.1\ \bar y =4.2\ s_y =0.9$
Test the hypothesis $\eta _x = \eta _y$, against $\eta _x > \eta _y$, with $\alpha = 0.05$

% Definitions
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Percentile}
	Given a distribution on random variable $x$ as $F_x(x)$, we define the $k^{th}$ percentile of this distribution as
	\begin{align}
		Percentile_k = F_x^{-1}(k)
		\label{eq:Percentile}
	\end{align}

	In other words, the $k^{th}$ percentile returns the value of random variable $x_0$ for which $F_x(x_0) = k$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Hypothesis}
	Let us assume, we are given a random variable $x$ whose distribution is $F(x, \theta)$ depending on some parameter $\theta$ (The parameter might be mean, variance etc.). We are required to use evidence that either supports or rejects a given prediction of the actual value of $\theta$, which we will call $\theta_0$.
	
	\begin{block}{Null Hypothesis}
		In the null hypothesis, we make the prediction that $\theta = \theta_0$. This is represented by $H_0 : \theta = \theta_0$.
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Alternate Hypothesis}
		In the alternate hypothesis, we make the prediction that $\theta \neq \theta_0$. This is represented by $H_1 : \theta \neq \theta_0$. Note that the null hypothesis may be defined differently based on utility.
	\end{block}	

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Testing Hypothesis}
	To test whether a given hypothesis is feasible based on evidence, we first define a random variable $q$ whose density is convenient to plot and is a function of sample vector $X$ as follows.
	\begin{align}
		q = g(X)
		\label{eq:TestStat}
	\end{align}
	We will call $q$ as the test statistic.

	The density of random variable $q$ is given by $p_q(q, \theta)$ where $\theta$ is the parameter. Now consider the density $p_q(q, \theta_0)$ (based on $H_0$) and a region (Critical Region) $R_c$ where $p_q(q, \theta_0)$ is negligible. If we find that the value of $q$ lies in $R_c$, then we reject $H_0$.

	One can decide the region $R_c$ using the significance level $\alpha$. $\alpha$ represents the probability that $q \in R_c$ when $H_0$ is true. Hence, when given a value of $\alpha$ one can determine $R_c$ and thereby check the validity of the null hypothesis. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Mean as Parameter: Unknown Variance}
	Consider a random variable $x$, from which we have obtained a sample vector $X$. We are required to reject or support the hypothesis $H_0: \eta = \eta_0$ against $H_1: \eta \neq \eta_0$, where we check if the mean $\eta$ equals a constant $\eta_0$.

	In the case that the variance is unknown but the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and sample variance $s^2$ are given, we must use a Student t distribution. Note that the sample vector $X$ has $n - 1$ degrees of freedom as we are constrained to ensure that the sum of the values of the vector $X - \bar{x}$ must be 0.

	Assuming random variable $\bar{x}$ is represented by a normal distribution, we define test statistic $q$ as follows:
	\begin{align}
		q = \frac{\bar{x} - \eta_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}
		\label{eq:UnknownVar}
	\end{align}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Mean as Parameter: Unknown Variance}
	For an alternate hypothesis $H_1: \eta \neq \eta_0$ and given significance value $\alpha$, we note that the critical region $R_c$ is given by:
	\begin{align}
		R_c = (t_{1-\alpha}(n - 1), \infty)
		\label{eq:CriticalReg}
	\end{align}

	where $t_k(n - 1)$ represents the $k^{th}$ percentile (As explained in \eqref{eq:Percentile})

	We consider the $\alpha^{th}$ and its complementary percentile as the given hypothesis is single ended, i.e., it allows us accept values less than the hypothesised mean value.

\end{frame}

\subsection{Transformation}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Stating the Transformation}
    Let, 
    \begin{align}
        w &= \bar x - \bar y = 0.4\\ 
        \implies \sigma _w^2 &= \frac{\sigma _x^2}{16} + \frac{\sigma _y^2}{26} = 0.32
    \end{align}
\end{frame}

% Stating hypothesis
\subsection{Hypothesis}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Stating the Hypothesis}
	We state the null Hypothesis as
	\begin{align}
		H_0 : \eta = 0
		\label{eq:NullHyp}
	\end{align}
	and the alternate hypothesis as
	\begin{align}
		H_1 : \eta  > 0
		\label{eq:AltHyp}
	\end{align}

	We are required to test the above hypotheses for significance value $\alpha = 0.05$
\end{frame}

% Calculating test statistic
\subsection{Test Statistic}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Calculate Test Statistic $q$}
	Given sample mean $\bar{x} =4.35$ and sample variance $s = 0.32 $, we get our test statistic $q$ from
	\eqref{eq:UnknownVar}
	as
	\begin{align}
		q = \frac{0.4 - 0}{0.32} = 1.223
		\label{eq:QVal}
	\end{align}
\end{frame}

% Making Decision
\subsection{Decision}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Making Decision}
	We shall determine the critical regions for given significance values $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ using
	\eqref{eq:CriticalReg}

	For $\alpha = 0.005$, we find that $t_{0.995} = 1.64$.As $q < 1.64$ we can accept this hypothesis.
